    <h2>Letra:</h2>
    <p>It's close to midnight<br>
        And something evil's lurking in the dark<br>
        Under the moonlight<br>
        You see a sight that almost stops your heart<br>
        You try to scream<br>
        But terror takes the sound before you make it<br>
        You start to freeze<br>
        As horror looks you right between the eyes<br>
        You're paralyzed<br>
        'Cause this is thriller, thriller night<br>
        And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike<br>
        You know it's thriller, thriller night<br>
        You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah<br>
        Ooh, ooh<br>
        You hear the door slam<br>
        And realize there's nowhere left to run<br>
        You feel the cold hand<br>
        And wonder if you'll ever see the sun<br>
        You close your eyes<br>
        And hope that this is just imagination<br>
        Girl, but all the while<br>
        You hear a creature creepin' up behind<br>
        You're out of time<br>
        'Cause this is thriller, thriller night<br>
        There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl<br>
        Thriller, thriller night<br>
        You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight<br>
        Night creatures call<br>
        And the dead start to walk in their masquerade<br>
        There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)<br>
        This is the end of your life, ooh<br>
        They're out to get you<br>
        There's demons closin' in on every side<br>
        They will possess you<br>
        Unless you change that number on your dial<br>
        Now is the time<br>
        For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah<br>
        All through the night<br>
        I'll save you from the terror on the screen<br>
        I'll make you see<br>
        That this is thriller, thriller night<br>
        'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try<br>
        Thriller, thriller night<br>
        So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller<br>
        Chiller, thriller here tonight<br>
        'Cause this is thriller, thriller night<br>
        Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try<br>
        Thriller, thriller night<br>
        So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow<br>
        I'm gonna thrill you tonight<br>
        Darkness falls across the land<br>
        The midnight hour is close at hand<br>
        Creatures crawl in search of blood<br>
        To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)<br>
        And whosoever shall be found<br>
        Without the soul for getting down<br>
        Must stand and face the hounds of hell<br>
        And rot inside a corpse's shell<br>
        I'm gonna thrill you tonight<br>
        Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)<br>
        I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)<br>
        Thriller, all night, oh baby<br>
        I'm gonna thrill you tonight<br>
        Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)<br>
        I'm gonna thrill you tonight<br>
        Thriller, all night (oh baby)<br>
        Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh<br>
        The foulest stench is in the air<br>
        The funk of forty thousand years<br>
        And grizzly ghouls from every tomb<br>
        Are closing in to seal your doom<br>
        And though you fight to stay alive<br>
        Your body starts to shiver<br>
        For no mere mortal can resist<br>
        The evil of the thriller</p>
